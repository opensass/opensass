> Hello, humble bumble dev 👋!

Today we're going to explore something **massive**, both literally and figuratively: **data tables with 1 million rows**.

Yep, that's right. We're not talking about a handful of to-do items or a polite little contacts list. We're talking **MILLIONS of rows**, real-world, backend-fed, browser-rendered **big boy data**.

And today, we're putting two contenders to the test:

- 🥊 **TanStack Table**, the battle-tested React data table library.
- 🥊 **Table RS**, the new WASM godly-powered table built with Rust + Yew.

You might think, "Wait... a WASM table? How different could it really be?". Oh, just hold my `cargo build`. Because what you're about to see is **not just a difference, it's a generational leap**.

Let's break it down, with **real numbers**, a little bit of **sass**, and a whole lot of **truth**.

## ⚔️ The Competitors: React vs WASM

### 🟨 TanStack Table (React)

[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest) is a beloved data-table library in the React ecosystem. Works great in many apps. Strong community. Solid virtualized rendering support. But... it still lives and breathes JavaScript. And JavaScript, dear friends, **struggles** when things get **huge**.

### 🟩 Table RS (Yew + WASM)

A newcomer, built in Rust, compiled to WASM, running in the browser with **near-native performance**. No virtual DOM. No garbage collection. Just pure speed, stability, and zero apologies.

## 📊 Benchmark: TanStack Table vs Table RS (1 Million Rows)

| Metric                           | **TanStack Table (React)**     | **Table RS (Yew + WASM)**        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Page Load Time (1M rows)**     | ~10 seconds                    | ~2 seconds                       |
| **Memory Heap Usage**            | >3 GB (heap overflow!)         | ~1.1 GB                          |
| **Initial Rendering**            | Heavy blocking, slow DOM paint | Efficient, lightweight rendering |
| **Browser Responsiveness**       | Laggy and delayed              | Smooth like butter               |
| **Sorting Performance**          | 2-4s for large columns         | Sub-1s 💨                        |
| **Search Performance**           | Acceptable, but sluggish       | Instant. Blink-and-it's-done     |
| **Lighthouse Performance Score** | 49/100                         | 60/100 (with 1M rows!)           |
| **Scalability**                  | Hits JS memory limits fast     | Laughs in WebAssembly            |

Let's be real: that's **not even close**. And if you're thinking "wait, maybe TanStack just needs some optimization", let me gently stop you right there...

## 🧠 Why TanStack Falls Apart

TanStack Table is amazing for **normal** data sets. But 1 million rows is where **JavaScript's weaknesses explode**:

- Memory consumption spikes to **3GB+** just to load data.
- Sorting or filtering starts to **choke the main thread**.
- React's reconciliation starts **gasping for air**.
- Eventually: 💥 **heap overflow errors**.

You might even get **browser crashes** depending on the system. It's not TanStack's fault. It's the platform.

## 🦾 Why Table RS Rocks So Hard

Table RS doesn't play around. It:

- Loads 1 million rows with **~1GB** memory.
- Sorts and filters **in milliseconds**.
- Doesn't need hydration.
- Doesn't virtualize, it just renders what's needed, **fast**.
- Compiles from Rust to Wasm = **native god-like binary performance in your browser**.

No garbage collection. No memory leaks. No jank. It's like putting a Formula 1 engine into your HTML table.

## 🚀 Real-World Experience

When testing both, here's what we saw:

- **TanStack Table**: 10+ second initial load. Browser lags. Dev tools freeze. Heap overflow during build when enabling aggressive queries.
- **Table RS**: Loads in **2 seconds flat**. Page remains responsive. Sorts in less than 1s. Feels native.

Even **Lighthouse** agrees:

| Metric                 | TanStack (React) | Table RS (WASM) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Performance Score      | 49/100           | 60/100          |
| Memory Stability       | ❌               | ✅              |
| First Contentful Paint | 4-5s             | ~1.1s           |
| CPU Blocking Time      | 🧱 Huge          | 😌 Minimal      |

Remember, that's with **1 million rows**. Not 10. Not 100. **A literal million**.

## 🔥 Why WebAssembly Is the Future

Let's put this simply:

- **JavaScript** is fine for interactive toys and CRUD apps.
- But when you need to go **beyond the limits of the VDOM**, you need **WASM**.
- Rust + Wasm **compiles to tiny, fast, deterministic code**.
- It's not just fast, it's **reliable**, **predictable**, and **insanely scalable**.

WASM doesn't guess. It doesn't garbage collect. It just runs.

React and JS frameworks are incredible for most apps, but they hit the ceiling **fast** when you're dealing with real data at scale.

## 📣 Final Verdict

| Category           | Winner   |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| Memory Efficiency  | Table RS |
| Rendering Speed    | Table RS |
| Browser Stability  | Table RS |
| Sorting/Filtering  | Table RS |
| Lighthouse Score   | Table RS |
| Developer Vibes 😎 | Table RS |

✅ If you're building a **real-world, data-heavy frontend**, and you care about:

- Speed.
- Memory.
- Reliability.
- And not making your users cry.

Then **Table RS with Yew + WASM** isn't just a cool idea. It's **the clear future** of frontend performance.

## 👋 Wrap-Up: JS Had a Good Run...

But it's time.

The web is moving toward **compiled, typed, high-performance apps**. And WASM is the rocket fuel that's going to power it. Rust + WASM let you build **massive-scale web apps** with **tiny, reliable performance footprints**. That's not just good engineering. That's **ethical development**. You're saving your users from slow pages and broken tabs.
