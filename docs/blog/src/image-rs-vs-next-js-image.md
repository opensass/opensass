> Hello, amazing developer! 👋

Today we are going to talk about something that may seem small at first glance, but is actually **super duper important** for building fast, reliable, and professional websites: **image components**.

And not just any image components, we're putting **Next.js's Native Image** head-to-head against the newer, shinier, Rust-powered **Image RS**.

You might think, "How different could two image components really be?". Well, sit tight, because the difference is not just big, it's **game-changing** when you actually dig under the surface.

This post will explain, in simple words, **why Image RS completely wins**, with **real facts**, **benchmarks**, and a few **good laughs** along the way.

Let's get started!

## ⚔️ Who Are The Competitors?

### 🥊 Next.js Image

[Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) is part of the popular React-based Next.js framework. It's been around for a while and is trusted by thousands of developers across the world. It does a good job of **optimizing images automatically**, helping with **SEO**, and **improving page loading speed** by lazy-loading images. It's very good when you are already working in a JavaScript and React environment, and it makes handling images much easier than doing it manually. It's reliable, it's solid, butt, at the end of the day, it is still **limited by JavaScript** and its natural problems (we'll talk about that later on).

### 🥊 Image RS

[Image RS](https://github.com/opensass/image-rs) is something **special**. It's a brand-new image component built specifically for **Rust-based frontend frameworks** like Yew, Dioxus, and Leptos. It runs inside the browser **through WebAssembly (Wasm)**, meaning it's written in **Rust**, then compiled into **blazing fast binary code** that the browser can run directly.

That means you are not using slow JavaScript, you are using the **godly power of Rust**, the language famous for being blazingly fast, reliable, and efficient. With Image RS, you don't just get a component that looks good, you get **raw, unmatched performance**, **fine-grained control** over how the image behaves, and **less memory usage**.

It's like upgrading from a scooter (Next.js Image) to a rocket ship (Image RS).

## 🧠 Why Image RS Wins

Let's break it down point by point. You'll see **exactly why** Rust + Wasm is a total game-changer.

### Native Rust + Wasm vs JavaScript

First, let's talk about how the two components are built.

- **Next.js Image** runs inside the browser using **JavaScript**, the traditional way websites have worked for years.
- **Image RS** runs using **WebAssembly (Wasm)** compiled from **Rust**, meaning it acts much closer to how native applications behave.

This matters a lot.

JavaScript is a **dynamic**, **garbage-collected** language, full of garbage. It's flexible, but it has a lot of overhead. Every time you load new images, update the DOM, or interact with elements, JavaScript engines need to **manage memory dynamically**, which sometimes leads to **random performance issues**, also known as [**jank**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Jank).

Meanwhile, Wasm is **strict** and **predictable**. Rust code running inside Wasm **manages memory very efficiently** and doesn't need a garbage collector. This means **no random pauses**, **no unexpected memory bloats**, and **super stable performance**, even under heavy loads.

When your app grows, and you start loading hundreds or thousands of images, this difference **becomes massive**.

| Feature          | Image RS | Next.js Image |
| :--------------- | :------- | :------------ |
| Native Rust+Wasm | ✅       | ❌            |

✅ **Clear Advantage: Image RS**

### Built-in Image Optimization: Both Are Good (Kind Of)

Here, both **Next.js Image** and **Image RS** have strong features. They both offer:

- **Automatic resizing** of images depending on the screen size.
- **Lazy loading** images so they only appear when the user scrolls near them.
- **Smart decoding** of images in a way that doesn't block page rendering.
- **Placeholder blurring**, so users see a nice blur before the full image loads.

These features are **must-haves** today because they dramatically improve page speed and user experience. In this case, both components are **equally great** when it comes to basic optimizations.

| Feature                     | Image RS | Next.js Image |
| :-------------------------- | :------- | :------------ |
| Built-in Image Optimization | ✅       | ✅            |

🤝 **Result: Tie**

### Fine-Grained DOM Control: WASM Takes the Crown

This is where **Image RS** starts pulling ahead strongly.

With Yew and Wasm, you have **fine-grained control over every single DOM node**. You can directly manipulate how each image behaves, how it loads, how it resizes, or how it triggers callbacks, all with the speed and safety of Rust.

Next.js Image, however, is tied deeply to **React's virtual DOM**. The virtual DOM is smart, but it's also a layer of abstraction that **gets in the way** when you need **precise, large-scale updates**.

If you need to load, say, **10,000 images**, Image RS can handle it **smoothly and efficiently** by updating the real DOM **surgically**.  
Next.js will struggle because updating the virtual DOM becomes **very expensive** and slow at this scale.

| Feature                  | Yew Image RS | Next.js Image |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :------------ |
| Fine-grained DOM Control | ✅           | ❌            |

🏆 **Clear Winner: Image RS**

### JS/Wasm Payload Size: Both Keep It Tight

One big concern in web development today is **bundle size**, you don't want users downloading megabytes of JavaScript just to open a simple page.

Luckily, both Next.js Image and Image RS are **optimized for small payloads**:

- Next.js uses [tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking) and [code-splitting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting) to send only the code you need.
- Yew compiles Rust code into **tiny Wasm binaries** that are often **smaller than equivalent JavaScript**.

Either way, you're not going to overload your user's internet connection.

| Feature                 | Yew Image RS | Next.js Image |
| :---------------------- | :----------- | :------------ |
| Smaller JS/Wasm Payload | ✅           | ✅            |

🤝 **Result: Tie**

## 📈 Real Benchmark Time.

We actually **measured** everything using **Lighthouse**, and the results speak for themselves.

### When Loading 10 Images (small scale)

| Metric            | Yew (Wasm) | Next.js |
| :---------------- | :--------- | :------ |
| Performance Score | 100        | 100     |
| Memory Usage      | 8 MB       | 8 MB    |

![Yew Image RS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/703d6623-c2b9-46a7-81fb-01c56dd13466)

At small sizes, both are lightning-fast. You won't notice much difference if you are only loading a few images. Both are **perfectly smooth and reliable** here.

### When Loading 10,000 Images (huge scale)

| Metric               | Yew (Wasm)  | Next.js        |
| :------------------- | :---------- | :------------- |
| Performance Score    | 64          | ❌ (FAILED)    |
| Memory Usage         | 78 MB       | 83 MB          |
| Scrolling Smoothness | Very Smooth | Laggy Disaster |

![Image RS Memory Usage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38b053ed-22af-48fc-a52c-617860fe33d3)
![Next JS Image Memory Usage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88580a9a-0036-4782-8d40-a98faa63e789)
![Next JS Image Lighthouse score failed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beecbee3-f021-4572-bd1d-6515de0e8f15)

Once we crank up the scale, the story changes:

- **Image RS** keeps its cool. Scrolling stays buttery smooth, memory usage is controlled, and the page is still responsive.
- **Next.js Image** completely falls apart. Lighthouse **couldn't even finish auditing** because the page became too slow and unresponsive.

✅ Image RS uses **less memory**, scrolls faster, and behaves like a professional athlete.

❌ Next.js Image **lags**, **stutters**, and **breaks** under the pressure.

## 🧪 Why Wasm + Rust Crushes JS + React

**Technical reason in simple words:**

- Rust gives **tight, efficient control over memory**.
- Wasm allows **direct execution** without needing garbage collection.
- No surprise pauses, no random memory leaks, no hidden costs.

Meanwhile, JavaScript has to:

- Constantly check and clean up memory.
- Handle garbage collection pauses unpredictably.

That's why Rust+Wasm simply **outperforms** JavaScript at any serious scale.

## 🎯 The Verdict

| Category             | Winner   |
| :------------------- | :------- |
| Native Performance   | Image RS |
| Fine-grained Control | Image RS |
| Massive Scaling      | Image RS |
| Developer Smugness   | Image RS |

✅ If you care about **speed**, **reliability**, **future-proof apps**, and **developer happiness**, then **Image RS** is the clear winner.

✅ If you want your app to handle not just today's needs but tomorrow's massive data scales, **Rust + Image RS** is the way to go.

✅ If you want **less pain, better performance, and cleaner code**, the answer is simple.

# 🚀 Final Thoughts

Next.js Image is good, for small apps where JavaScript's overhead doesn't show. But if you're dreaming big? If you're building **modern apps that scale**? If you want **buttery-smooth UX** no matter what? Then **Image RS** isn't just an option. It's the obvious next step.

So don't let your users suffer slow load times and laggy scrolling. **Give them the Wasm experience they deserve.** 🚀
